This folder contains data for the colleges that we have defined as
the "MACRO" region around PCC. The colleges are as follows:

- Los Angeles Trade Tech College
- Los Angeles City College
- Citrus College
- Mt. San Antonio College
- Los Angeles Valley College
- Cerritos College
- West Los Angeles College
- Los Angeles Southwest College
- Compton College
- Los Angeles Mission College
- Long Beach City College
- El Camino College
- Santa Monica College

By definition, the "MACRO" region data will include the colleges
listed above AND the colleges listed in the "MICRO" region.

Each college has its own folder with its own individual .csv file
containing student citizenship status info.

The .csv file that is NOT sorted into any folders is a
combination of all colleges' student count into a single .csv. 
I queried the data this way so that it might be easier to work 
with. However, you might have to concatenate the data from the 
colleges individually regarding citizenship status. 
I have provided this data for each college into its separate folder.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
