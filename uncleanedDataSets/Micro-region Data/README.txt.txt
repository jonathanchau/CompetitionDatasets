This folder contains data for the colleges that we have defined as
the "MICRO" region around PCC. The colleges are as follows:

- Rio Hondo
- ELAC
- GCC

Each college has its own folder with its own individual .csv files
containing student count and student citizenship status info.

The .csv files that are NOT sorted into any folders are a
combination of all colleges into a single .csv. I queried
the data this way so that it might be easier to work with. 
However, if you would prefer to concatenate the data from the 
colleges individually, I have provided the respective data from 
each college into its separate folder.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
